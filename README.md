# P01_Currency_Forecasting
The theme of the project is currency exchange rate prediction. 
More specifically, I will focus on the EUR / PLN currency pair. 
The motivation to choose this particular pair is the fact that I am Polish and the Polish zloty is my national currency. 
Additionally, Poland belongs to the European Union, which makes the Polish economy highly dependent on the euro area. 
The second fact is that for some 2 years I have had daily contact with currency exchange because I receive a large part of my salary in euros, which is why it is important for me to predict and guess trends that are happening in this currency pair. Efficient selling and sometimes buying can easily improve my monthly income slightly.

The project is divided into three notebooks:

1) Collecting, transforming, supplementing and combining data for analysis
2) Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA
3) Time Series Forecasting with Machine Learning models
